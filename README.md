# Snelgrove Blog
Simple static blog built using [Perun](https://github.com/hashobject/perun) 
a static site tool built using the very cool Clojure build tool [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/). 

## Setup
```
brew install boot-clj

# Clone and cd to dir
# To work locally, compile markdown and serve on localhost:3000
boot dev

# First time it runs you'll see Boot fetch all the dependencies from Clojars
# and install them in your local Maven repository. 
```
